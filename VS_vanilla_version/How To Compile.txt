To build and run the program, use any IDE that has a compiler compatible with C++ (Such as Microsoft Visual Studio 2019). 
It should be noted that the project file will need to be unzipped.
Once Visual Studio (VS) has been opened, ensure all .h files contained within the zip file are copied into the header file directory.
Similarly, all the .cpp files (including the main.cpp) will need to be moved into the source file directory of VS. 
The solution can then be built and once it has been, the program can be started.

"Grid.h" - contains the class declartion for the Grid class
"Grid.cpp" - contains the method defintions for the Grid class
"Junction.h" - contains the class declartion for the Junction class
"Junction.cpp" - contains the method defintions for the Junction class
"PedestrianLight.h" - contains the class declartion for the PedestrianLight class
"PedestrianLight.cpp" - contains the method defintions for the PedestrianLight class
"Road.h" - contains the class declartion for the Road class
"Road.cpp" - contains the method defintions for the Road class
"TrafficLight.h" - contains the class declartion for the TrafficLight class
"TrafficLight.cpp" - contains the method defintions for the TrafficLight class
"User.h" - contains the class declartion for the User class
"User.cpp" - contains the method defintions for the User class
"RoadUser.h" - contains the class declartion for the RoadUser class
"RoadUser.cpp" - contains the method defintions for the RoadUser class
"Pedestrian.h" - contains the class declartion for the Pedestrian class
"Pedestrian.cpp" - contains the method defintions for the Pedestrian class
"main.cpp" - controls the simulation of the traffic light network (enables user control)
